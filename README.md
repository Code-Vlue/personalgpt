# Personal GPT

This is a personal project that I worked on, its just a simple chat window to chat with chat GPT and may be good for testing an API key.

## How to get it working

This is a react project so I would suggest doing the following

1. In VS Code open a terminal and CD into the project root directory

2. Run the command `npx create-react-app .` after that is done also run `npm install axios` and `npm install openai` this will install all the needed modules to run the react site

3. Go into the root directory of the project in VS Code, you will find a file named .env and inside you will see where you need to input your API key

4. Run the command `npm start` and use the test site to check if the API key works or to just have a personal page to run GPT on.
